This is done by making a new hotbar, going into options for it, and binding every key in it (or at least the first 7) to a single key, then assigning the following buttons to that new hotbar. Barrage (Rush) Chameleon Strike Beastial Rending (Vivisection) Bale's Maelstrom Frozen Cyanin Rotsil's Bite Frostrift Lance This will allow you to spam a single button to do most of your DPS work. Every time you press the button, #1, #2, and #3 will fire if avaiable, and the first nuke of 4, 5, 6, and 7 will fire that is available. You can think of the nuke order as a priority order, with the best nukes placed earlier. Swarm Pets and DoTs If a mob is going to last at least 20 seconds, your swarm pet will outshine all of your other DPS options. Your poison and disease DoTs will outshine all of your nukes. Priority is Swarm pet, then poison DoT, then disease DoT. The disease DoT can be skipped entirely on fights < 1 minute or on highly resistant targets, as it often gets resisted and your nukes will make up the gap. The Swarm Pet or the Swarm Pet/Growl hybrid spell are great targets for gift of mana procs Growl and Feralgia Growl of the Lion will increase the melee DPS of your and your pet by 20% while also healing you over time. This does not stack with Empathic Fury or Anguish Click , but growl is now a self buff, so you can run it at the same time as anguish click. You will get growl and your pet will keep the anguish click for a bigger boost to the pet. Feralgia can be used to re-up Growl and summon your swarm pet at the same time. Rules of Engagement Make an attack hotkey that makes sure Bestial Rending is up before turning on attack to get benefit of it before your first round of combat and chameleon strike. Chameleon strike is in there as an agro dump for the round so that your initial agro will be lower, giving the tank more time to stabilize even if you attack too early. Your /assist setting should be set to /assist off to benefit from this fully. I keep /stand in these buttons for those events where things like to FD you. /stand /disc bestial rending /attack on /pet attack /disc chameleon strike You should also have an attack off hotkey like the following that allows you to stop everything in the event of an emergency. /stand /pet back off /attack off /stop Hit assist to get target ( /assist off should be the default setting, use a different button for turning on attack and sending pet) Let the tank position the mob and hit it for a round or two Press your attack hotkey from above Cast swarm pet, poison dot, and disease dot (if disease is resisted, just move on, it happens a lot) For the rest of the fight: Mash Mash Mash Mash Mash Recast swarm pet on cooldown Re-up DoTs as needed Pay attention to mechanics, DPS isn't everything Burns Bestial Rending should be up at all times during combat, endurance permitting. We have the following burns for our group: ~10 minute burns Group Bestial Alignment Spire of the Savage Lord ~20 minute burns Nature's Fury + all of the 10 minute burns We have the following burns for ourselves: ~5 minute burns Anguish BP Click ~10 minute burns Frenzy of Spirit Current Expansion BP Click ~20 minute burns Bestial Alignment Empathic Fury Panic Buttons Your spiky DPS on engage will also tend to get you agro on engage.
